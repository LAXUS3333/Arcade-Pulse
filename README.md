#Database needs to be set up first
1. Install MySQL
Download and install MySQL on your new PC if it's not already installed. Ensure you have the same or a compatible version as the previous PC to avoid compatibility issues.
2. Copy the Exported File
Locate the exported .sql file from your previous database and transfer it to your new PC.
3. Access phpMyAdmin
Open phpMyAdmin on your new PC. Typically, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
4. Create a New Database
In phpMyAdmin:
Click on the Databases tab.
Create a new database with a name of your choice (or the same as the exported one if needed).
Click Create.
5. Import the Database
In phpMyAdmin:
Click on the newly created database in the sidebar.
Go to the Import tab.
Click on Choose File, then select your exported .sql file.
Ensure the format is set to SQL.
Click Go to start the import.
6. Verify the Import
After the import is complete, check the database to ensure all tables and data are correctly restored.

Now just download the zip files from here, unzip them, run the xampp server and copy the folder in your Users.Go to any browser and access the site writing localhost/php-ecommerce-app/Login.php and you're good to go.
